This is a sample carousel application, also known as image slider in where user can see one or more images grouped in a slider.
User can navigate through each and every image by easily clicking the Next and Previous buttons in the slide.
For each slide there user can see  a Title and a Sub-title as well.

You can see 3 seperate sliders over here for demo purpose and the details for those are as follows.

- Slider 1 - Having only one image( No Arrows ) , infinite false.
- Slider 2 - Having 4 images, with infinite navigation true.
